# Vanilla Library Manager

## About
A simple library manager crafted using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, thus the "vanilla"
part in the name. This project is part of The ODIN Project Fullstack curriculum which I'm 
currently enrolling in. 

You can try the [live demo](https://rachyd.works/vanilla-library).
